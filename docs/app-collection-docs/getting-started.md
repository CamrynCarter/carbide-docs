# Getting Started

### Using the Carbide Secured Registry (CSR)

As with the other products in the Carbide Suite, you can pull artifacts from the Carbide Secured Regsitry to seed your private registry. This can be done in both connected and airgapped environments. 

Please ensure you have the [Prerequisites](/docs/registry-docs/prereqs.md) and follow the [Seeding a Registry](/docs/registry-docs/copying-images.md) steps. 

### Using Helm

For applications with helm charts, you can pull the latest chart and use HelmOps to manage your desired apps. The Carbide Portal conveniently provides the `helm pull` command as applicable.
