# Introduction

### What is the RGS Application Collection? 

The RGS Application Collection (AppCo) offers a curated, trusted, and up-to-date set of developer and infrastructure applications that are production-ready. This collection of open source applications is rebuilt on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Image (SLE BCI), which reduces attack surface and dependency vulnerabilities. 

RGS Application Collection is updated often to ensure you have the latest application versions available and dependency bumps are done frequently. We also scan regularly so you have updated vulnerability data available.

### What's the difference between the RGS Application Collection and SUSE App Collection? 

The RGS Application Collection offers the same rebuilt application images as SUSE. However, while the applications are the same, RGS AppCo metadata is different. The images are delivered via the [Carbide Secured Registry](/docs/registry-docs/introduction.md), with SLSA L3 pipelines, SBOM generation, vulnerability scans, and cryptographically verifiable artifacts. RGS AppCo is also available on the Carbide Portal and integrated with [Hauler](https://docs.hauler.dev/docs/intro) for easy air-gapping. 

### How can I access the collection? 

Your current license will automatically grant you access to these artifacts. If you're having trouble accessing the collection, or if you aren't yet a Carbide customer but are interested in trying it out, please [contact sales](https://ranchergovernment.com/the-rancher-government-subscription).
