# Introduction

### What is the RGS Application Collection? 

The RGS Application Collection (AppCo) offers a curated, trusted, and up-to-date set of developer and infrastructure applications for development and production. This collection of open source applications is rebuilt on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Image (SLE BCI), which reduces attack surface and dependency vulnerabilities. 

RGS Application Collection is updated regularly to ensure you have the latest application versions available and dependency bumps are done frequently. We also scan regularly so you have updated vulnerability data available. 

RGS AppCo is delivered via the [Carbide Secured Registry](/docs/registry-docs/introduction.md), with SLSA L3 pipelines, SBOM generation, vulnerability scans, and cryptographically verifiable artifacts. AppCo is also available on the RGS Customer Portal and integrated with `Hauler`.

### How can I access the collection? 

As RGS Rancher Carbide Suite or RGS Rancher Carbide customers, AppCo is included in your subscription. Your current license should automatically grant you access to these artifacts. If you're having trouble accessing the collection, or if you aren't yet a Suite or Carbide customer but are interested in trying it out, please [contact sales](https://ranchergovernment.com/the-rancher-government-subscription).
