# Using STIGATRON (TODO SCREENSHOTS)

1. After installing STIGATRON on your downstream cluster, when you navigate to that downstream cluster, you should see STIGATRON on the left navigation menu. Click there.

3. After the scan runs (should only take a few minutes at most), click the 3-dot menu next to the scan and go to Open Visualizer. This will give you insight into the current state of your cluster in relation to the RKE2 STIG.
